<h2>User guide. Part II. Bot abilities</h2>
<p><b>Why do we need a bot?</b></p>
<p>Bot gives you a wonderful opportunity to manage your projects via the popular messenger <b>Telegram</b> which makes your work much more convenient.</p>
<p>You can create <b>project chats</b> to monitor all activity in general on your project,
    which can help you to spot all bottlenecks of your project, so you could manage them.</p>
<p>You can also create <b>issue chats</b> to control some specific, maybe especially important tasks.</p>
<p>The bot will notify you about everything you consider important! If a task or a chat related to a task has been deleted, the bot sends a notification to this chat and leaves it. The bot will monitor all chats created on the chat configuration page.</p>

<b>List of events reported by the bot:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Issue Created</li>
    <li>Issue Resolved</li>
    <li>Issue Closed</li>
    <li>Issue Assigned</li>
    <li>Issue Deleted</li>
    <li>Issue Commented</li>
    <li>Issue Comment Edited</li>
    <li>Issue Deleted</li>
    <li>Issue Reopened</li>
    <li>Issue Progress Started</li>
    <li>Issue Generic Event</li>
</ul>
<i>Please note, that if you want to receive notifications about status changes, you should make sure that you have the correct events configured on your workflow.</i>
<br>
<i><b>Example:</b> if you want to receive notification about the Issue Resolved event, make sure that you have this event added to the transition's Post Functions</i>
