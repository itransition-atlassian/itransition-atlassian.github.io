<p><b>Note:</b> When adding a member to the chat:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>
        If the user is not in the chat owner's contact list or the user has privacy settings enabled, a notification will appear after adding them to the chat:
        <br>
        <a href="#" onclick="return false;">
            <img onclick="makeFullScreen(this)" class="screenshot-small fullscreen"
                 title="Click the image to open in full size"
                 src="../../assets/img/screenshots/telegram/cloud/telegram-chats-page-invited-member-message.png"/>
        </a>
        <br>
        Also, the user will have a corresponding icon in the member list:
        <br>
        <a href="#" onclick="return false;">
            <img onclick="makeFullScreen(this)" class="screenshot-small fullscreen"
                 title="Click the image to open in full size"
                 src="../../assets/img/screenshots/telegram/cloud/telegram-chats-page-invited-member.png"/>
        </a>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> <i>On the Telegram side, the bot will send an invitation link to this user for the current chat.</i>
        <br>
        Until the added user accepts the invitation, they cannot be appointed as a chat administrator. If an attempt is made to appoint them as an administrator, a repeat chat invitation will be sent to them !
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Also, you can see the following message:
        <br>
        <a href="#" onclick="return false;">
            <img onclick="makeFullScreen(this)" class="screenshot-small fullscreen"
                 title="Click the image to open in full size"
                 src="../../assets/img/screenshots/telegram/cloud/telegram-chats-page-bot-no-start.png"/>
        </a>
        <br>
        This message contains a list of users who have not sent the /start command to the bot.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the user in the members lists has the following icon:
        <br>
        <a href="#" onclick="return false;">
            <img onclick="makeFullScreen(this)" class="screenshot-small fullscreen"
                 title="Click the image to open in full size"
                 src="../../assets/img/screenshots/telegram/cloud/telegram-chats-page-member-logout.png"/>
        </a>
        <br>
        This indicates that the member has logged out of the Telegram application plugin and needs to log in again on the plugin authorization page.
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> <i>This user can only be removed from the members lists.</i>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> If instead of the chats page you see the following message, you need to authenticate. How to do this is described in the <a href="/telegram/cloud/user-registration.html"><span>User guide. Part I. Registration</span></a>.</p>
