    </a>
    <br>
    Then go to the issue, to which you want to connect chat, or to the <b>Chats</b> section and click <b>Add to existing chat</b> button.
    Then you will see modal window with <b>Connection key</b> field, where you should paste <b>key</b>, sent by bot.
    <br>
    <br>

             title="Click the image to open in full size"
             src="../assets/img/screenshots/telegram/user-2-connect-chat-jira.png"/>
    </a>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> This option is available for admin and users, who have connected their Telegram accounts with jira by sending <b>/start</b>
    command to bot (full authentication with code and password is required only for <b>editing</b> connected chats).
