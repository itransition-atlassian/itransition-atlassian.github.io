<h2>User guide. Part III. Bot abilities</h2>
<p><b>Why do we need a bot?</b></p>
Bot manages all chats created from Jira.
<br>
Bot checks recently added users, and,
if they are registered in Telegram Integration, t
hey can see this chat in the list in project menu.
Otherwise bot posts in chat a warning message.
<br>
Bot sends notifications about changes in JIRA. Notification schema is the same as schema for emails.
<br>
List of events reported by the bot:
<ul>
    <li>Issue created</li>
    <li>Issue resolved</li>
    <li>Issue closed</li>
    <li>Issue assigned</li>
    <li>Issue deleted</li>
    <li>Issue comment edited</li>
    <li>Issue deleted</li>
</ul>
<br>If issue or chat for issue was deleted, bot sends notification to this chat and leaves it.
<br>If user edits a message in chat with "<b>autopost messages in comments</b>" feature enabled, comment also will be edited.
<br>Bot can be added only in chats, created from Jira.
