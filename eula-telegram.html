<p>
    We may offer you a time-limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited license for

    Versions is subject to any additional terms specified by us and is only permitted for the evaluation period
    designated by us. After the evaluation period is expired you must abide by the standard use rights, or must remove
    and delete all copies of the Plugin in your possession. You may not use Beta Versions for competitive analysis or
    similar purposes. Licensor may terminate your right to use Beta Versions at any time and for any reason in its sole
    discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta products (“Beta Versions”) are
    still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than
    generally available products. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. All
    information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of Beta Versions constitutes our confidential
    information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with
    respect to Beta Versions, including any support services, warranty, and indemnity obligations.
</p>
<h3>Warranties</h3>
<p>
    You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Plugin is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to
    satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.
</p>
<p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Plugin is provided "as is" and “as available”, with all
    faults and without warranty of any kind, and we hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions with respect to the
    Plugin, either express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties and/or
    conditions of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet
    enjoyment, and non-infringement of third party rights. We do not warrant against interference with your enjoyment of
    the Plugin, that the functions contained in the Plugin will meet your requirements, that the operation of the Plugin
    will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects in the Plugin will be corrected. No oral or written information
    or advice given by us or our authorised representative shall create a warranty.
</p>
<h3>Support and Maintenance</h3>
<p>
    Any support and maintenance of the Plugin shall be provided by us on a best-effort basis for valid License holders.
    Our failure to provide support and maintenance will not entitle you to any remedies from us.
</p>
<p>
    Support requests and/or requests for advice must be reported by emailing at <a href="mailto:atlassian@itransition.com">atlassian@itransition.com</a>
    or through
    messaging in the telegram group located at <a href="https://t.me/ItransitionAtlassianSupp">https://t.me/ItransitionAtlassianSupp</a>
</p>
<h3>Data Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
    When we receive and/or process your support requests and/or requests for advice, some of your personal data might
    become available to us or might be asked for by us such as, but not limited to, your name, email address, IP address
    of a server, server’s location and user agent. This data is handled in accordance with all applicable laws and
    strictly to process your requests.
</p>
<p>
    We have implemented privacy and security measures reasonably adequate to preserve your personal data from loss,
    misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
</p>
<p>
    As we are a part of a multinational group of companies, we might subcontract some services related to the Plugin,
    including processing of the End-users requests, to our affiliated companies. For this reason, your personal data may
    be transferred outside the country where you are located. This includes countries outside the European Economic Area
    with no adequate level of personal data protection (third countries). As some of the countries where our affiliated
    companies are situated are not yet recognized by the European Commission as countries with an adequate level of
    personal data protection, these companies have access to personal data on the basis of instruments that cover the
    European Union requirements for the transfer of personal data to data controllers/processors outside the European
    Union (Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission). You may ask us to inspect copies of these
    clauses by contacting us at the email address stated below.
</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>
    You acknowledge that the Plugin has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is
    therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Plugin meet your requirements.
</p>
<p>
    You will indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Licensor against any and all claims, proceedings, demands and costs
    resulting from or in any way connected with your use of the Plugin. In no event (including, without limitation, in
    the event of negligence) will Licensor be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive
    damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of use, business interruption,
    loss of information or data, or pecuniary loss), in connection with or arising out of or related to this EULA, the
    Plugin or the use or inability to use it or the furnishing, performance or use of any other matters hereunder
    whether based upon contract, tort or any other theory including negligence.
</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>
    You may terminate this license at any time by destroying all your copies of the Plugin.
</p>
<p>
    Any failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA will result in automatic and immediate termination
    of this license. On termination: (i) all rights granted to you under this EULA shall cease; (ii) you must
    immediately stop all activities authorized by this EULA, including the Plugin’s use; (iii) you must immediately
    delete or remove the Plugin, and immediately destroy all copies of the Plugin then in your possession, custody or
    control.
</p>
<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>
    This EULA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the English law. Licensor and End-user agree that
    the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    Each of the conditions of this EULA operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of
    them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<h3>Revisions of this EULA</h3>
<p>
    We may update, modify or amend this EULA from time to time. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you about the
