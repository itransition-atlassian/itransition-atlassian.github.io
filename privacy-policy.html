<h2>Data security & privacy statement</h2>

<h3>Data stored in our apps</h3>
<p>
    Our apps store all information in the corresponding Atlassian server product. All data is located in your IT system
    (server or data center) that hosts the Atlassian server product.

    No information stored on the installation IT system is made available to us when you install the app. The app does
    not transmit data from your IT system or from the end-user's web browser to us or to any third-party.
</p>
<h3>Data requested by our Customer Support</h3>
<p>
    When having problems or questions related to our apps, you may contact our Customer Support team. Depending on the
    issue we may request server log files, configuration files, database query results or other type of diagnostic
    information, which you are free to give to us.

    Those are only used to analyze and solve your individual issue. After the issue is resolved, those are permanently
    deleted.
